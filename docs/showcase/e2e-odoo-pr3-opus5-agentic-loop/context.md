## Description
## Summary

Fixes [odoo/odoo#271153](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/271153).

`remove_control_characters` in `odoo/tools/xml_utils.py` is meant to enforce the XML 1.0 `Char` production before text is handed to lxml (EDI / UBL / quote PDF paths via `account.tools.dict_to_xml`).

### Root cause

The function built a Unicode character class, then **`.encode()`d the pattern** and applied it as a **bytes** regex to UTF-8 payloads. Encoding multi-byte ranges (e.g. `\uE000-\uFFFD`) collapses them into accidental single-byte ranges. Net effect: only a few C0 controls were removed; **U+FFFE / U+FFFF** (and other non-XML code points) survived.

Callers then assign the string to `element.text`, and lxml raises:

```text
ValueError: All strings must be XML compatible: Unicode or ASCII, no NULL bytes or control characters
```

### Fix

1. Compile the illegal-char class once and filter on **Unicode code points**.
2. Accept `str` or `bytes` and return the **same type** (backward compatible for `cleanup_xml_node` which passes bytes).
3. `dict_to_xml`: pass `str` directly instead of encode→scrub→decode.
4. Regression tests in `test_testing_utilities` covering str/bytes, allowed controls (`\t\n\r`), lxml assignment, and type errors.

### Risk

- Touches a shared XML sanitizer used by EDI/export paths.
- Behavior change is intentional: characters that were incorrectly kept are now stripped (matches the documented API).
- No intentional change to allowed XML characters.

### Tests

- `TestRemoveControlCharacters` in `odoo/addons/test_testing_utilities/tests/test_xml_tools.py`
